<h2 style="text-align:center">CHAPTER I</h2>
<p style="text-align:center">    We live in strange times, when strange things happen which at first
    sight seem unintelligible and the reason for which we fail to grasp.
    Even in Russia, where Rasputin had become the most talked-of person
    in the whole empire, few people fully realised what he was and what
    had been the part which he had played in Russia’s modern history. Yet
    during the last ten years his name had become a familiar one in the
    palaces of the great nobles whose names were written down in the Golden
    Book of the aristocracy of the country, as well as in the huts of the
    poorest peasants in the land. At a time when incredulity was attacking
    the heart and the intelligence of the Russian nation the appearance of
    this vagrant preacher and adept of one of the most persecuted sects
    in the empire was almost as great an event as was that of Cagliostro
    during the years which preceded the fall of the old French monarchy.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center">    There was, however, a great difference between the two personages.
        One was a courtier and a refined man of the world, while the other
        was only an uncouth peasant, with a crude cunning which made him
        discover soon in what direction his bread could be buttered and what
        advantages he might reap out of the extraordinary positions to which
        events, together with the ambitions of a few, had carried him. He was
        a perfect impersonation of the kind of individual known in the annals
        of Russian history as “Wremienschtchik,” literally “the Man of the
        Day,” an appellation which since the times of Peter the Great had clung
        to all the different favourites of Russian sovereigns. There was one
        difference, however, and this a most essential one. He had never been
        the favourite of the present Czar, who perhaps did not feel as sorry as
        might have been expected by his sudden disappearance from the scene of
        the world.</p>

    </p>
    <p>
    I shall say a thing which perhaps will surprise my readers. Personally,
    Rasputin was never the omnipotent man he was believed to be, and
    more than once most of the things which were attributed to him were
    not at all his own work. But he liked the public to think that he
    had a finger in every pie that was being baked. And he contrived to
    imbue Russian society at large with such a profound conviction that
    he could do absolutely everything he chose in regard to the placing
    or displacing of people in high places, obtaining money grants and
    government contracts for his various “protégés,” that very often the
    persons upon whom certain things depended hastened to grant them to
    those who asked in the name of Rasputin, out of sheer fright of finding
    this terrible being in their way. They feared to refuse compliance with
    any request preferred to them either by himself or by one who could
    recommend himself on the strength of his good offices on their behalf.
    But Rasputin was the tool of a man far more clever than himself, Count
    Witte. It was partly due to the latter’s influence and directions that
    he tried to mix himself up in affairs of state and to give advice to
    people whom he thought to be in need of it. He was an illiterate brute,
    but he had all the instincts of a domineering mind which circumstances
    and the station of life in which he had been born had prevented
    from developing. He had also something else--an undoubted magnetic
    force, which allowed him to add auto-suggestion to all his words and
    which made even unbelieving people succumb sometimes to the hypnotic
    practices which he most undoubtedly exercised to a considerable extent
    during the last years of his adventurous existence.
    </p>
    <p>
    Amidst the discontent which, it would be idle to deny, had existed
    in the Russian empire during the period which immediately preceded
    the great war the personality of Rasputin had played a great part
    in giving to certain people the opportunity to exploit his almost
    constant presence at the side of the sovereign as a means to foment
    public opinion against the Emperor and to throw discredit upon him by
    representing him as being entirely under the influence of the cunning
    peasant who, by a strange freak of destiny, had suddenly become far
    more powerful than the strongest ministers themselves. The press
    belonging to the opposition parties had got into the habit of attacking
    him and calling his attendance on the imperial court an open scandal,
    which ought in the interest of the dynasty to be put an end to by every
    means available.
    </p>
    <p>
    In the Duma his name had been mentioned more than once, and always
    with contempt. Every kind of reproach had been hurled at him, and
    others had not been spared. He had become at last a fantastic kind
    of creature, more exploited than exploiting, more destroyable than
    destructive, one whose real “rôle” will never be known to its full
    extent, who might in other countries than Russia and at another time
    have become the founder of some religious order or secret association.
    His actions when examined in detail do not differ very much from those
    of the fanatics which in Paris under the reign of Louis XV. were called
    the “Convulsionnaires,” and who gave way to all kind of excesses
    under the pretext that these were acceptable to God by reason of the
    personality of the people who inspired them. In civilised, intelligent,
    well-educated Europe such an apparition would have been impossible,
    but in Russia, that land of mysteries and of deep faiths, where there
    still exist religious sects given to all kinds of excesses and to
    attacks of pious madness (for it can hardly be called by any other
    name), he acquired within a relatively short time the affections of a
    whole lot of people. They were inclined to see in him a prophet whose
    prayers were capable of winning for them the Divine Paradise for which
    their hungry souls were longing. There was nothing at all phenomenal
    about it. It was even in a certain sense quite a natural manifestation
    of this large Russian nature, which is capable of so many good or
    bad excesses and which has deeply incrusted at the bottom of its
    heart a tendency to seek the supernatural in default of the religious
    convictions which, thanks to circumstances, it has come to lose.
    </p>
    <p>
    The American public is perhaps not generally aware of the character of
    certain religious sects in Russia, which is considered to be a country
    of orthodoxy, with the Czar at its head, and where people think there
    is no room left for any other religion than the official one to develop
    itself. In reality, things are very different, and to this day, outside
    of the recognised nonconformists, who have their own bishops and
    priests, and whose faith is recognised and acknowledged by the State,
    there are any number of sects, each more superstitious and each more
    powerful than the other in regard to the influence which they exercise
    over their adherents. These, though not numerous by any means, yet are
    actuated by such fanaticism that they are apt at certain moments to
    become subjects of considerable embarrassment to the authorities. Some
    are inspired by the conviction that the only means to escape from the
    clutches of the devil consists in suicide or in the murder of other
    people.
    </p>
    <p>
    For instance, the Baby Killers, or Dietooubitsy, as they are called,
    think it a duty to send to Heaven the souls of new-born infants, which
    they destroy as soon as they see the light of day, thinking thus to
    render themselves agreeable to the Almighty by snatching children away
    from the power of the evil one. Another sect, which goes by the name
    of Stranglers, fully believes that the doors of Heaven are only opened
    before those who have died a violent death, and whenever a relative
    or friend is dangerously ill they proceed to smother him under the
    weight of many pillows so as to hasten the end. The Philipovtsy preach
    salvation through suicide, and the voluntary death of several people in
    common is considered by them as a most meritorious action. Sometimes
    whole villages decide to unite themselves in one immense holocaust and
    barricade themselves in a house, which is afterward set on fire.
    </p>
    <p>
    An incident that occurred during the reign of Alexander II. is
    remembered to this day in Russia. A peasant called Khodkine persuaded
    twenty people to retire together with him into a grotto hidden in the
    vast forests of the government of Perm, where he compelled them to die
    of hunger. Two women having contrived to escape, the fanatics, fearing
    that they might be denounced, killed themselves with the first weapons
    which fell under their hand. It was their terror that they might find
    themselves compelled to renounce their sinister design, and thus fall
    again into the clutches of that Satan for fear of whom they had made
    up their minds to encounter an awful death. Even as late as the end of
    the last century such acts of fanaticism could be met with here and
    there in the east and centre of Russia. In 1883, under the reign of the
    father of the last Czar, a peasant in the government of Riazan, called
    Joukoff, burnt himself to death by setting fire to his clothes, which
    he had previously soaked in paraffin, and expired under the most awful
    torments, singing hymns of praise to the Lord.
    </p>
    <p>
    Among all these heresies there are two which have attracted more
    than the others the attention of the authorities, thanks to their
    secret rites and to their immoral tendencies. They are the Skoptsy,
    or Voluntary Eunuchs, about which it is useless to say anything here,
    and the Khlysty, or Flagellants, which to this day has a considerable
    number of adepts and to which Rasputin undoubtedly belonged, to which,
    in fact, he openly owed allegiance. This sect, which calls itself “Men
    of God,” has the strangest rites which human imagination can invent.
    According to its precepts, a human creature should try to raise its
    soul toward the Divinity with the help of sexual excesses of all kinds.
    During their assemblies they indulge in a kind of waltz around and
    around the room, which reminds one of nothing so much as the rounds of
    the Dancing Dervishes in the East. They dance and dance until their
    strength fails them, when they drop to the floor in a kind of trance or
    ecstasy, during which, being hardly accountable for their actions, they
    imagine that they see Christ and the Virgin Mary among them. They then
    threw themselves into the embrace of the supposed divinities.
    </p>
    <p>
    As a rule the general public knows very little concerning these sects,
    but I shall quote here a passage out of a book on Russia by Sir Donald
    Mackenzie Wallace, which is considered to this day as a standard work
    in regard to its subject. “Among the ‘Khlysty,’” he writes, “there
    are men and women who take upon themselves the calling of teachers
    and prophets, and in this character they lead a strict, ascetic
    life, refrain from the most ordinary and innocent pleasures, exhaust
    themselves by long fasting and wild ecstatic religious exercises and
    abhor marriage. Under the excitement caused by their supposed holiness
    and inspiration, they call themselves not only teachers and prophets,
    but also Saviours, Redeemers, Christs, Mothers of God. Generally
    speaking, they call themselves simply gods and pray to each other as
    to real gods and living Christs and Madonnas. When several of these
    teachers come together at a meeting they dispute with each other in a
    vain, boasting way as to which of them possesses most grace and power.
    In this rivalry they sometimes give each other lusty blows on the ear,
    and he who bears the blows the most patiently, turning the other cheek
    to the smiter, acquires the reputation of having the most holiness.
    </p>
        <p>
        “Another sect belonging to the same category and which indeed
        claims close kindred with it is the Jumpers, among whom the
        erotic element is disagreeably prominent. Here is a description
        of their religious meetings, which are held during summer in a
        forest and during winter in some outhouse or barn. After due
        preparation prayers are read by the chief teacher, dressed in
        a white robe and standing in the midst of the congregation.
        At first he reads in an ordinary tone of voice and then
        passes gradually into a merry chant. When he remarks that the
        chanting has sufficiently acted on the hearers he begins to
        jump. The hearers, singing likewise, follow his example. Their
        ever-increasing excitement finds expression in the highest
        possible jumps. This they continue as long as they can--men
        and women alike yelling like enraged savages. When all are
        thoroughly exhausted the leader declares that he hears the
        angels singing, and then begins a scene which cannot be here
        described.”
        </p>
    </p>
    I have quoted this passage in full because it may give to the reader
    who is not versed in the details of Russian existence and Russian
    psychology the key to the circumstances that helped Rasputin to absorb
    for such a considerable number of years the attention of the public in
    Russia, and which, in fact, made him possible as a great ruling, though
    not governing, force in the country. In some ways he had appealed
    to the two great features of the human character in general and of
    the Russian character in particular--mysticism and influence of the
    senses. It is not so surprising as it might seem at first sight that he
    contrived to ascend to a position which no one who knew him at first
    ever supposed he would or could attain.
    
    At the same time I must, in giving a brief sketch of the career of
    this extraordinary individual, protest against the many calumnies
    which have associated him with names which I will not mention here out
    of respect and feelings of patriotism. It is sufficiently painful to
    have to say so, but German calumny, which spares no one, has used its
    poisoned arrows also where Rasputin came to be discussed. It has tried
    to travesty maternal love and anxiety into something quite different,
    and it has attempted to sully what it could not touch. There have been
    many sad episodes in this whole story of Rasputin, but some of the
    people who have been mentioned in connection with them were completely
    innocent of the things for which they have been reproached. Finally,
    the indignation which these vile and unfounded accusations roused in
    the hearts of the true friends and servants of the people led to the
    drama which removed forever from the surface of Russian society the
    sectarian who unfortunately had contrived to glide into its midst.
    
    The one extraordinary thing about Rasputin is that he was not murdered
    sooner. He was so entirely despised and so universally detested all
    over Russia that it was really a miracle that he could remain alive so
    long a time after it had been found impossible to remove him from the
    scene of the world by other than violent means. It was a recognised
    fact that he had had a hand in all kinds of dirty money matters and
    that no business of a financial character connected with military
    expenditure could be brought to a close without his being mixed in
    it. About this, however, I shall speak later on in trying to explain
    how the Rasputin legend spread and how it was exploited by all kinds
    of individuals of a shady character, who used his name for purposes
    of their own. The scandal connected with the shameless manner in
    which he became associated with innumerable transactions more or less
    disreputable was so enormous that unfortunately it extended to people
    and to names that should never have been mentioned together with him.
    
           *       *       *       *       *
    
    It must never be forgotten, and I cannot repeat this sufficiently,
    that Rasputin was a common peasant of the worst class of the Russian
    moujiks, devoid of every kind of education, without any manners and in
    his outward appearance more disgusting than anything else. It would be
    impossible to explain the influence which he undoubtedly contrived to
    acquire upon some persons belonging to the highest social circles if
    one did not take into account this mysticism and superstition which lie
    at the bottom of the Slav nature and the tendency which the Russian
    character has to accept as a manifestation of the power of the divinity
    all things that touch upon the marvellous or the unexplainable.
    Rasputin in a certain sense appeared on the scene of Russian social
    life at the very moment when his teachings could become acceptable, at
    the time when Russian society had been shaken to its deepest depths by
    the revolution which had followed upon the Japanese war and when it was
    looking everywhere for a safe harbour in which to find a refuge.
    
           *       *       *       *       *
    
    At the beginning of his career and when he was introduced into the most
    select circles of the Russian capital, thanks to the caprices and the
    fancies of two or three fanatic orthodox ladies who had imagined that
    they had found in him a second Savonarola and that his sermons and
    teachings could provoke a renewal of religious fervour, people laughed
    at him and at his feminine disciples, and made all kinds of jokes, good
    and bad, about him and them. But this kind of thing did not last long
    and Rasputin, who, though utterly devoid of culture, had a good deal
    of the cunning which is one of the distinctive features of the Russian
    peasant, was the first to guess all the possibilities which this sudden
    “engouement” of influential people for his person opened out before
    him and to what use it could be put for his ambition as well as his
    inordinate love of money. He began by exacting a considerable salary
    for all the prayers which he was supposed to say at the request of his
    worshippers, and of all the ladies, fair or unfair, who had canonised
    him in their enthusiasm for all the wonderful things which he was
    continually telling them. He was eloquent in a way and at the beginning
    of his extraordinary thaumaturgic existence had not yet adopted the
    attitude which he was to assume later on--of an idol, whom every one
    had to adore.

    THE EX-CZAR AND HIS FAMILY]
    
           *       *       *       *       *
    
    He was preaching the necessity of repenting of one’s sins, making
    due penance for them after a particular manner, which he described
    as being the most agreeable to God, and praying constantly and with
    unusual fervour for the salvation of orthodox Russia. He contrived
    most cleverly to play upon the chord of patriotism which is always so
    developed in Russians, and to speak to them of the welfare of their
    beloved fatherland whenever he thought it advantageous to his personal
    interests to do so. He succeeded in inspiring in his adepts a faith
    in his own person and in his power to save their souls akin to that
    which is to be met with in England and in America among the sect of
    the Christian Scientists, and he very rapidly became a kind of Russian
    Mrs. Eddy. A few hysterical ladies, who were addicted to neuralgia or
    headaches, suddenly found themselves better after having conversed or
    prayed with him, and they spread his fame outside the small circle
    which had adopted him at the beginning of his career. One fine day a
    personal friend of the reigning Empress, Madame Wyroubourg, introduced
    him at Tsarskoie Selo, under the pretext of praying for the health
    of the small heir to the Russian throne, who was occasioning some
    anxiety to his parents. It was from that day that he became a personage.
    
           *       *       *       *       *
    
    His success at court was due to the superstitious dread with which
    he contrived to inspire the Empress in regard to her son. She was
    constantly trembling for him, and being very religiously inclined, with
    strong leanings toward mysticism, she allowed herself to be persuaded
    more by the people who surrounded her than by Rasputin himself. She
    believed that the man of whose holiness she was absolutely persuaded,
    could by his prayers alone obtain the protection of the Almighty for
    her beloved child. An accidental occurrence contributed to strengthen
    her in this conviction. There were persons who were of the opinion
    that the presence of Rasputin at Tsarskoie Selo was not advantageous
    for many reasons. Among them was Mr. Stolypine, then Minister of the
    Interior, and he it was who made such strong representations that at
    last Rasputin himself deemed it advisable to return to his native
    village of Pokrovskoie, in Siberia. A few days after his departure the
    little Grand Duke fell seriously ill and his mother became persuaded
    that this was a punishment for her having allowed the vagrant preacher
    to be sent away. Rasputin was recalled, and after this no one ever
    spoke again of his being removed anywhere. From that time all kinds of
    adventurers began to lay siege to him and to do their utmost to gain an
    introduction.
    
    Russia was still the land where a court favourite was all-powerful,
    and Rasputin was held as such, especially by those who had some
    personal interest in representing him as the successor to Menschikoff
    under Peter the Great, Biren under the Empress Anne and Orloff under
    Catherine II. He acquired a far greater influence outside Tsarskoie
    Selo than he ever enjoyed in the imperial residence itself, and he
    made the best of it, boasting of a position which in reality he did
    not possess. The innumerable state functionaries, who in Russia
    unfortunately always have the last word to say everywhere and in
    everything and whose rapacity is proverbial, hastened to put themselves
    at the service of Rasputin and to grant him everything which he asked,
    in the hope that in return he would make himself useful to them.
    
    A kind of bargaining established itself between people desirous of
    making a career and Rasputin, eager to enrich himself no matter by what
    means. He began by playing the intermediary in different financial
    transactions for a substantial consideration, and at last he thought
    himself entitled to give his attention to matters of state. This was
    the saddest side of his remarkable career as a pseudo-Cagliostro. He
    had a good deal of natural intelligence, and while being the first to
    laugh at fair ladies who clustered around him, he understood at once
    that he could make use of them. This he did not fail to do. He adopted
    toward them the manners of a stern master, and treated them like his
    humble slaves. At last he ended by leading the existence of a man of
    pleasure, denying himself nothing, especially his fondness for liquor
    of every kind. At that time there was no prohibition in Russia and,
    like all Russian peasants, Rasputin was very fond of vodka, to which he
    never missed adding a substantial quantity of champagne whenever he
    found the opportunity.
    
    I shall abstain from touching upon the delicate point of the orgies
    to which it is related that Rasputin was in the habit of addicting
    himself, the more so because I do not really believe these ever took
    place in those higher circles of society where it was said they
    regularly occurred. That strange things may have happened among the
    common people, who in far greater numbers than it has ever been known,
    used to attend the religious meetings which he held, I shall not deny.
    It must always be remembered that Rasputin belonged to the religious
    sect of the Khlysty, of whose assemblies we have read the description,
    and it is quite likely, and even probable, that the assemblies of these
    sectarians at which he presided were not different from the others to
    which these heretics crowded. But I feel absolutely convinced that as
    regards the relations of the adventurer with the numerous ladies of
    society silly enough to believe in him and in his gifts of prophecy,
    these consisted only of superstitious reverence on one side and
    exploitation of human stupidity on the other.
    
    I must once more insist on the point that the apparition of Rasputin
    in Russian society had nothing wonderful about it, and that the only
    strange thing is that such a fuss was made. Before his time people
    belonging to the highest social circles had become afflicted with
    religious manias of one kind or another out of that natural longing for
    something to believe in and to worship which lies hidden at the bottom
    of the character of every Russian who has the leisure, or the craving,
    to examine seriously the difficult and complicated problems of a future
    life and of the faith one ought to follow and to believe in.
    
    In 1817 there was discovered in the very heart of St. Petersburg,
    holding its meetings in an imperial residence (the Michael Palace), a
    religious sect of most pronounced mystical tendencies, presided over
    by a lady belonging to the best circles of the capital--the widow of a
    colonel, Madame Tatarinoff. In her apartments used to gather officers,
    State functionaries, women and girls of good family and excellent
    education who, with slight variations, practised all the religious
    rites of the Khlystys. One of the Ministers of Alexander I., Prince
    Galitzyne, was suspected of having honoured these assemblies with his
    presence. Thanks to a letter which accidentally fell into the hands
    of the police, the Government became aware of what was going on, and
    Madame Tatarinoff, this Russian Madame Guyon, expiated in exile in a
    distant province of Siberia the ecstasies which she had practised and
    which she had allowed others to practise under her roof. Some of her
    disciples were prosecuted, but the greater number escaped scot free.
    The authorities did not care to increase the scandal which this affair
    had aroused in the capital.
    
    Much later, in 1878, after the Russo-Turkish war, which, like the
    Japanese affair, had been followed by a strong revolutionary movement
    in the country that culminated in the assassination of the Czar,
    Alexander II., another prophet, this time of foreign origin, appeared
    on the social horizon of St. Petersburg society, where he made a
    considerable number of converts. This was the famous Lord Radstock,
    whose doctrines were taken up by a gentleman who up to that time
    had been known as one of the gayest among the gay, a colonel in the
    Guards--Mr. Basil Paschkoff. He was enormously rich, and put all his
    vast fortune at the service of the religious craze which had seized
    him. He used his best efforts to convert to the doctrine of salvation
    through faith only not alone his friends and relatives, but also the
    poorer classes of the population of the capital, devoting in particular
    his attention to the cab drivers. All these people used to meet at
    his house, where they mingled with persons of the highest rank and
    standing, such as Count Korff, and a former Minister, Count Alexis
    Bobrinsky. Later on the whole Tchertkoff family, to which belonged
    the famous friend of Count Leo Tolstoy, associated itself with them,
    and, indeed, displayed the greatest fanaticism in regard to its
    participation in the doctrines of the new sect.
    
    The Paschkovites, as they came to be called, had nothing at all in
    common with the Khlystys. Their morals were absolutely unimpeachable,
    and what they preached was simply the necessity to conform one’s morals
    were absolutely unimpeachable, and what they explained and commented
    upon, each person according to his own light. They were Protestants in
    a certain sense, inasmuch as their views were distinctly Protestant
    ones. But they had much more in common with the nonconformists than
    the real followers of Luther or of Calvin. They were a kind of refined
    Salvation Army, if this expression can be forgiven me; though they
    never acquired the importance, nor did the good which the latter has
    done, perhaps because they could never make any practical application
    of the principles and of the ideas which animated them. But at one time
    the Paschkovist craze was just as strong as the Rasputin one became
    later on, and Lord Radstock and Mr. Paschkoff were considered just as
    much prophets among their own particular circle as was Rasputin among
    the fanatical ladies who had taken him up.
    
    These crises of religious mania are regular occurrences in Russian
    higher social circles when unusually grave circumstances arrive to
    shake their equanimity. Seen from this particular point of view,
    the apparition of Rasputin and the importance which his personality
    acquired in the life of the Russian upper classes present nothing very
    wonderful. Before him other so-called prophets had kept the attention
    of the public riveted upon their doings and their actions.
    
    What distinguished his short passage was the fact that it was made
    the occasion by the natural enemies of the empire, consisting of the
    discontented at home, and of the Germans outside the frontier, to
    discredit the dynasty as well as those whose life was spent in its
    immediate vicinity and to present this figure of the vagrant half-monk
    and half-layman, who preached a new relation to those foolish enough to
    listen to him, as being one of almost gigantic importance, who could at
    his will and fancy direct the course of public affairs and lead them
    wherever he wanted.
    
    My object in this study will be to show Rasputin for what he really
    was, and in retracing the different vicissitudes of his strange career,
    not to give way to the many exaggerations, which, in familiarising
    people abroad with his person and with his name, have made out of him
    something quite wonderful, and almost equal in power with the Czar
    himself. It is time to do away with such legends and to bring Rasputin
    back to his proper level--a very able and cunning, half-cultured
    peasant, who owed his successes only to the fanaticism of the few, and
    to the interest which many had in dissimulating themselves behind him,
    in order to bring their personal wishes to a successful end. It is not
    Rasputin who performed most of the actions put to his credit. It was
    those who influenced him, who pushed him forward and who, thanks to
    him, became both rich and powerful. He has disappeared. I wish we could
    be as sure that they have disappeared along with him.
